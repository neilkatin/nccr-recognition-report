## Neil Katin, Jan 2020

Automate the generation of recognition reports for the American Red Cross Northern California Region.

There will be three parts of the app:

* connect to volunteerconnection.redcross.org and run the report, capturing the output.
* convert the report to a different layout
* email the modified report to a distribution list
